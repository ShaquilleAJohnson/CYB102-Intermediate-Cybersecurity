# CYB102-Intermediate-Cybersecurity
An ongoing efforts to I collection the best practices and techniques, libraries and frameworks, E-books and videos, websites, blog posts, links to github Repositories, technical guidelines and important resources in Cybersecurity.

Intermediate Cybersecurity (CYB102)
üìö Course Description
In this 10-unit course, students explore the fundamentals of blue-team cybersecurity. Students will learn how to use real-world threat intelligence platforms to explore and analyze threat data, use SIEM systems to collect security data from endpoints, appropriately correlate data, evaluate and triage events, and use gathered data to perform incident management (document, track, escalate). Students will also learn how to use tools to perform vulnerability scanning, packet sniffing, and threat hunting.

Course Goals
At the completion of the course, students are expected to:

explore and analyze threat data using real-world threat intelligence platforms
use SIEM systems to collect security data from endpoints
appropriately correlate data, evaluate and triage events
use gathered data to perform incident management (document, track, escalate)

üôã Student Expectations
Prior Knowledge
Students entering the program are expected to:

Have introductory knowledge of programming, computing, and linux terminal commands
Be pursuing a course of study related to computer science or software that includes hands-on programming/scripting experience
In other words, you should be able to:

write basic scripts using Bash programming
navigate a simple Linux CLI environment
(if you want to practice, try this learning game!)
have a grasp of basic computer programming concepts (in any language)
follow tutorials to set up and install new software
ask questions and üöÄ explore interesting things
Through the completion of the prework you will also learn how to:

brush up on your Bash programming skills
Time Commitment
Students are expected to commit 7-9 hours a week during the duration of the 10-week program.

2 hour synchronous class time
5-7 hrs asynchronous work time on projects

üèóÔ∏è Course Structure
Key Activities
Synchronous Class Sessions: Students will meet synchronously once a week with their instructor.
Optional Office Hours: Attend office hours led by TAs. This is a time to ask questions about projects or topics in a smaller environment.
Topics Schedule
Week	Topic	Key Concepts / Tools
1	Blue Team Defense Concepts	"What is a Blue Team?", SOC, Wireshark
2	Endpoint Monitoring	Logs, Vulnerability Scanning, HIDS tools
3	Network Monitoring: Hosts	Common network protocols, packet sniffing, Snort
4	Network Monitoring: Enterprise	Network layers, proxy servers, DOS attacks
5	SIEM Systems	UEBA, SIEM Systems, Splunk
6	Incident Response	Attack vectors, triage, containment, recovery
7	Threat Intelligence	Information sharing, ATT&CK, CAR, CAPEC
8	HUNT	Threat Hunting, Indicators of Compromise
9	SOAR	SOAR, Automated response, Playbooks
10	Group Project Sharing Day	Deep-dive data analysis and presentation
Projects
In this course you will have the opportunity to apply your understanding of the topics discussed in class and incorporate your own creativity through projects and labs.

Individual Projects: You will work on a total of 7 projects from weeks 1-7. They should take approximately 5-7 hours to complete and will be submitted at the end of the week.
Group Capstone Project: You will work on a group project in teams of 4-6 members. This will be an ongoing project from weeks 8-10.
The table below specifies the percentage weight a given section of the course has on the final grade.

Weight	Section	Description
50%	Assignments	Weekly cybersecurity projects
50%	Group Project Milestones	Deep-dive data analysis and presentation

üöÄ Capstone Project
For their final project, students will work in small groups to choose a sample data set, identify, analyze, and form a remediation plan for the incident, then share their findings in a final presentation.
