# CYB102-Intermediate-Cybersecurity
An ongoing efforts to I collection the best practices and techniques, libraries and frameworks, E-books and videos, websites, blog posts, links to github Repositories, technical guidelines and important resources in Cybersecurity.

## üìö Course Description
In this 10-unit course, students explore the fundamentals of blue-team cybersecurity. Students will learn how to:

- Use real-world threat intelligence platforms to explore and analyze threat data.
- Use SIEM systems to collect security data from endpoints.
- Correlate data, evaluate, and triage events.
- Use gathered data to perform incident management (document, track, escalate).
- Perform vulnerability scanning, packet sniffing, and threat hunting.

## Course Goals
By the end of the course, students will be able to:

1. Explore and analyze threat data using real-world threat intelligence platforms.
2. Use SIEM systems to collect security data from endpoints.
3. Appropriately correlate data, evaluate, and triage events.
4. Use gathered data to perform incident management (document, track, escalate).

## üôã Student Expectations

### Prior Knowledge
Students should have:

- Introductory knowledge of programming, computing, and Linux terminal commands.
- Experience in computer science or software with hands-on programming/scripting.

Students should be able to:

- Write basic scripts using Bash.
- Navigate a simple Linux CLI environment.
- Understand basic computer programming concepts.
- Follow tutorials to set up and install new software.
- Ask questions and explore interesting topics.

### Time Commitment
- 2 hours of synchronous class time per week.
- 5-7 hours of asynchronous work time on projects per week.
- Total: 7-9 hours per week for 10 weeks.

## üèóÔ∏è Course Structure

### Key Activities
- **Synchronous Class Sessions:** Weekly meetings with the instructor.
- **Optional Office Hours:** TA-led sessions for questions about projects or topics.

|--------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 50%    | Assignments               | Weekly cybersecurity projects            |
| 50%    | Group Project Milestones  | Deep-dive data analysis and presentation |

## üöÄ Capstone Project
Students will work in small groups to choose a sample data set, identify, analyze, and form a remediation plan for the incident. The project will culminate in a final presentation of their findings.
